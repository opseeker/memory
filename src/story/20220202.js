    <p className="p1">It was a very troublesome day for me as on this very day, Manisha got fierce and fought with me a bit to the point where I was totally ashamed of myself.</p>
    <p>Well sort of, it was all my own mistake that I made. I got a call from my EX and we talked casually. However she asked me that if I was intrested in being together with her again like before. 
        It was a very hard decission to make on the spot as I was quiet the person who dosen't want to make enemies or hurt the others. I said let me think for a while and I will get you the answer. 
        I think this is where I made the wrong move because this single decission made this day very worse day.</p>
        <p>Later, she messeged me on WhhatsApp a "Hi", and I replied that... this part was also one of the great problems that I made and I regret that later during night. 
            After all, she was being good to me and asked me if I was doing fine, but I did think though that- even after knowing the fact that she left me, and also having known that I am with someone else, 
            why did she try to persuade me? What was her purpose? This is still a mystery and a question to ponder upon.</p>
        <p>Jeez... Now I got to tell you that- what happened after all of that. Well you get a rough idea right? Yep, as you thought, we had an argument, a lengthy and big one at that.
            I initially thought that telling her about this would defiinately make her upset and maybe she would be angry with me. But I could not do that, I told her everything that happened and asked her 
            what I must do. She yelled at me saying that I should have denied my EX on the spot. And she even asked me to do whatever I want, saying that I go cheat in front of her not hiiding the fact. That really hurt like hell ya'know?
            After all she must have been pretty stressed to hear that my EX tried contacting me, and here I just made a big mistake delaying my answer to my EX that I can't be with her anymore as I am in a serious relattionship with someone I really love.
        </p>
        <p>I later did as she told me to, I gave my EX a reply saying- I have a girl in my life. This were just enough words to make her understand what I was trying to say.</p>
